# Single-cycle-MIPS-processor

This is an implementation of a single-cycle processor that uses an architecture which is similar to MIPS architecture. This processor supports the following instructions:

* Arithmetic/Logical Instructions: add, addi, sub, slt, slti
* Memory Reference Instruction: lw, sw
* Control Flow Instructions: j, jal, jr, beq, bne

Test Program: The "instructions.txt" file contains a set of assembly language instructions which calculates the sum of the elements of an array and stores the result at the 2000th index of memory.
